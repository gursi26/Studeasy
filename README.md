# Features
Our project provides a suite of functionality for students, allowing them to greatly increase the rate at which they absorb information by removing the repetitive tasks from their routine. Some of our functionalities include:

1. A revision notes generator that can generate quick revision notes based on a given topic and level of comprehension.
2. A test generator that generates questions based on subject, level of comprehension (high school, college, middle school), and difficulty. It then allows users to enter their own answers and grades their answers out of 100, also providing feedback.
3. A document summarizer that can read entire documents like textbooks and research papers within seconds and output a summary of a desired section.
4. A syllabus information extracter that extracts commonly required information such as assignment weightages, office hours, regrade and late submission policies, etc.
